In a nutshell: learning to code is *hard*. 

It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted, which is why it's been so exciting for me.

When you sit down to write a complex app, there are bugs that will appear that you'll never anticipate starting out, along with a series of unknown unknowns that you'll have to figure out.

But I digress...

## On Learning to Code

Early on in my experience with Free Code Camp, Quincy Larson shared an article that detailed just why learning to code is just so difficult, and the process newcomers will face with fancy graphs and everything. A lot of it made sense on a lot of levels, but I didn't quite believe it. Once you learn the technologies thoroughly enough, you should be able to just crank out software easily, right? Nope.

That article was dead on.

Gaining a deep understanding of JavaScript as well as libraries and frameworks like jQuery, React, Angular, plus back end tools like NodeJS, Express, and the multitude of others you choose to use is only half the battle. More like a fraction of the battle. Learning how to use the languages, frameworks, and tools is just like learning how to use mountain climbing gear and practicing on an indoor climbing wall. 

You still have to climb the mountain. 

Nothing can prepare you for putting everything together to actually write software, so you just have to do it--and fail over and over again until you solve each problem. You'll fail better and recover faster each time.

In the real world, many companies are building software that has no precedent. Custom programs and libraries become nesseary to solve incredible problems that no one has built a good solution for yet. Facebook responded to a situation like that by building React, along with many other custom tools.

On the other hand, most smaller companies are building software for user stories that have been solved over and over again. Those apps can be very complex as well, but if you've built enough similar apps on a small scale, you can help put out some amazing products that scale. Very few apps out in the wild are as deep and complex as Facebook or Netflix and need to run on everything from a 2G phone in India to a cable box.

That was a pretty abstract explanation, so let's dig a bit deeper.
