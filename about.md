I am a Front End Developer with Full-Stack tendencies.

You can find my projects at [MattTrifilo.com](http://www.MattTrifilo.com), [CodePen](http://www.codepen.io/dprsky), and [GitHub](https://github.com/itxchy).

This blog was generated by Jekyll, using Mark Otto's excellent Lanyon Theme. Thanks Mark!
