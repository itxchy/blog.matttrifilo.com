        Navigating the Unknown Unknowns

    <p>As new coders traverse the vast, treacherous landscape of modern JavaScript developement in 2017, many chasms in knowledge appear out of the fog that can stop them in their tracks. There’s no avoiding it. There’s no guessing where they might even arise at times.</p>

<p>In my case, the first “knowledge chasm” of many appeared after completing Codecademy’s JavaScript course, and finishing all of Free Code Camp’s beginner algorthim challenges. I felt pretty confident. JavaScript was becoming familiar, and I built web pages with HTML, CSS, and jQuery with increasing ease.</p>

<p>Then came the Free Code Camp Intermediate Front End Development challenges to build simple client-side apps like a quote generator and a weather app. I barely knew where or how to begin. The guided trail ended and the time came to venture into wild. Blocking the way I wanted to go was a gaping, vertical ravine. How do you cross it? The simple answer is to find the right tools you need to repel down and then climb up the other side. Learn which tools to use when, where, and why, learn them well, learn how to use them together, and you can reach your goal. Easy right? Not so much.</p>

    <p>At the end of May, I finally completed my <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/itxchy/front-end-certification">Front End Certification</a> for Free Code Camp.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve spent some time refactoring a few of my older projects to get them to a place where I don’t cringe every time I look at the source code. They were pretty grisly. My Pomodoro app from last year in particular was a hacky mess. It was my first project trying out AngularJS, and while it worked, it broke pretty much every relavent style in <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md">John Papa’s style guide</a>. Here’s the <a href="http://codepen.io/dprsky/pen/OymXEp">old source</a> if you have a strong stomach. All of the logic was in one controller and $scope was polluted with almost every variable in the project. Not even one service to handle business logic. The controller was in charge or user interactions, business logic, <em>and</em> state. The horror. It must be destroyed. I didn’t even know how to use a service versus a controller at the time. It’s a small app, and the design-pattern-less layout of the code was well commented, but it would have quickly turned into a field of thorns if it ever needed new features. Good code should be mostly self-documenting anyway. I took this as an oppurtunity to refactor the app’s code <a href="https://johnpapa.net/angular-app-structuring-guidelines/">structure</a> and logic to separate concerns (UI elements, <a href="https://johnpapa.net/sharing-data-in-an-angular-controller-or-an-angular-service/">state</a>, application logic, user interaction handling) and get some practice using Angular 1.5’s great new <a href="https://toddmotto.com/exploring-the-angular-1-5-component-method/">component method</a>, modeled after Angular 2’s component pattern. That’s a story for another blog post, but it was a humbling learning experience, and Angular 1’s paradigm makes so much more sense now on every level.</p>

<p>The new pomodoro source code is <a href="https://github.com/itxchy/FCC-pomodoro">here</a>.</p>

<p>It’s far from perfect, but application state is maintained in a single shared service (not spread out all over the application), the controllers simply handle user interactions, and the application structure is organized by feature.</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-redux">Redux</a> would greatly <a href="http://blog.rangle.io/managing-state-redux-angular/">impove the state handling</a>, but that’s for another day.</p>

<p>I thought I’d christen this shiny new blog with a reflection of how I got to this point. This post will be long (okay, it’s a novel), but this will be a good chance for me to reflect on the past few years that have been a roller coaster to say the least.</p>
